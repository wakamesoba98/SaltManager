\n
\u00A0\u00A0(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n

\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n

\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n

\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n
\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n

\n
\u00A0\u00A0You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
\u00A0\u00A0may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
\u00A0\u00A0for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
\u00A0\u00A0for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
\u00A0\u00A0reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n
\u00A0\u00A0the conditions stated in this License.\n

\n
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
\u00A0\u00A0agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
\u00A0\u00A0Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n
\u00A0\u00A0WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
\u00A0\u00A0implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
\u00A0\u00A0of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
\u00A0\u00A0PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
\u00A0\u00A0appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
\u00A0\u00A0risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
\u00A0\u00A0whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n
\u00A0\u00A0unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n
\u00A0\u00A0negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n
\u00A0\u00A0liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
\u00A0\u00A0incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
\u00A0\u00A0result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n
\u00A0\u00A0Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
\u00A0\u00A0work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n
\u00A0\u00A0other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
\u00A0\u00A0has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n
\u00A0\u00A0the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n
\u00A0\u00A0and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
\u00A0\u00A0or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
\u00A0\u00A0License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
\u00A0\u00A0on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
\u00A0\u00A0of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
\u00A0\u00A0defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n
\u00A0\u00A0incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n
\u00A0\u00A0of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n
